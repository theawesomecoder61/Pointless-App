# Pointless App
A simple app testing iOS 8's Today Widget API. The app literally serves no purpose.

## What it looks like

The GIF above was recorded on the iPhone Simulator running iOS 8.2.

## Written in entirely Objective-C!
Or Cocoa, however you call it.

## Requires iOS 8.0 or newer
The Today Widget API is only supported on iOS 8 or newer.

## How to use this thing
1. Download the repo
2. Open Xcode (if you have a Mac) and run the **.xcodeproj** file
3. **Note!** There is no developer or certificate linked to the project, so you could upload the app to the App Store if you'd like
