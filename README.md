# Pointless App
A simple app testing iOS 8's Today Widget API. The app literally serves no purpose.

The GIF above was recorded on the iPhone Simulator.

## How to use this
1. Download the repo
2. Open Xcode (if you have a Mac) and run the **.xcodeproj** file.
3. **Note!** There is no developer or certificate linked to the project, so you could upload the app to the App Store if you'd like.
